<h1>Internet Speed Calculator</h1><p>The Internet Speed Calculator is a web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to calculate their internet speed based on the time it takes to download a file.</p><h2>How to Use</h2><ol><li>Open the <code>index.html</code> file in your web browser.</li><li>You will see an input field where you can enter the file size in megabytes (MB).</li><li>Click the "Start" button to begin the download simulation.</li><li>The application will measure the time it takes to complete the download.</li><li>Once the download is finished, the calculated internet speed will be displayed in megabits per second (Mbps).</li></ol><h2>Files</h2><p>The project contains the following files:</p><ul><li><code>index.html</code>: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the application and handles user interactions.</li><li><code>styles.css</code>: The CSS file that provides styles and layout for the application.</li><li><code>script.js</code>: The JavaScript file that implements the logic for measuring the download time and calculating the internet speed.</li></ul><h2>Customization</h2><p>You can customize the Internet Speed Calculator by modifying the following aspects:</p><ul><li>File sizes: By default, the application expects the file size to be entered in megabytes (MB). If you want to use a different unit, you can modify the HTML and JavaScript code accordingly.</li><li>Styling: Feel free to modify the CSS file to change the appearance of the application, such as colors, fonts, or layout.</li></ul><h2>Browser Compatibility</h2><p>The Internet Speed Calculator is built using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and should be compatible with most modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.</p><h2>License</h2><p>This project is licensed under the <a >MIT License</a>.

# Virtual Keyboard

The Virtual Keyboard is a web-based application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It emulates the functionality of a physical keyboard, allowing users to input text and interact with web applications using their mouse or touch input.

## Features

- Virtual Keyboard Layout: The keyboard replicates the layout of a standard physical keyboard, including alphabetical and numerical keys.
- Interactive Input: Users can click or tap on the virtual keys to input characters into text fields or text areas.
- Multi-language Support: The virtual keyboard supports multiple languages, allowing users to switch between different keyboard layouts.
- Customization: The keyboard's appearance and behavior can be customized using CSS and JavaScript, providing flexibility to match the design and functionality requirements of different applications.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. The virtual keyboard will be displayed on the screen.
3. Click or tap on the keys to input characters into text fields or text areas.
4. To switch between different keyboard layouts, click or tap on the language selector or any other control provided.

## Files

The project contains the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the application and handles user interactions.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that provides styles and layout for the virtual keyboard.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that implements the logic for handling user input and managing the keyboard behavior.

## Customization

You can customize the Virtual Keyboard by modifying the following aspects:

- Keyboard Layout: The keyboard layout can be modified in the HTML file by rearranging the keys or adding/removing keys as needed.
- Styling: Feel free to modify the CSS file to change the appearance of the virtual keyboard, such as colors, fonts, or layout, to match your application's design.
- Language Support: To add support for additional languages, you can modify the JavaScript code to include the specific keyboard layouts and handle language switching.

## Browser Compatibility

The Virtual Keyboard is built using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and should be compatible with most modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
